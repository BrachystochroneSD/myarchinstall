* MyArchInstall
  My shell script to install my arch linux config on any device from scratch in three steps:
  - First step:
    - Create Grub partition table
    - Install Arch linux with all of my packages
    - Generate FSTab
    - Setup Local and Timezone
    - Setup Hostname
  - Second Step:
    - Install Grub
    - Create root pass and new user
  - Third Step:
    - Install AUR packages
    - Mount Zenocloud and get auth info from it
    - Create SSH and send it to my git

* Personnal shit
   As you can see, this is for now a personnal script. It's not meant to be used by anyone, but you can if you want. And maybe I will make it universal and adaptative.

   If you want to try it, just do a in arch usb boot installer:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrachystochroneSD/myarchinstall/master/myarchinstall.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

* TODO list
  - Ask for prompt shits first
  - efi boot
  - polybar battery config tweaks or script
  - gpg key handling for authinfo
